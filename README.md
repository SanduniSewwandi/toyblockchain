# Toy Blockchain and Ledger Simulator

A simple blockchain and ledger simulator implemented in **Go**, developed as part of the **Backend Engineering Internship – Golang Developer Assessment**.

The project demonstrates the core concepts behind blockchain technology, including deterministic hashing, Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, blockchain validation, ledger reconstruction, transaction validation, persistence, and command-line interaction.

Rather than building a production blockchain, the objective is to implement the essential blockchain mechanisms in a clean, modular, and well-tested Go application.

`blockchain.json` and `pending.json` are created automatically the first time the program runs and are not committed to version control — see `.gitignore`.

# Requirements

- Go 1.22 or newer (per `go.mod`)

Check your Go installation:

```bash
go version
```

---

# Building the Project

Clone the repository and build the application.

```bash
go build
```

or run directly:

```bash
go run main.go
```

---

# Configuration Flags

Flags are parsed once, at startup, and must come **before** the command:

```bash
go run main.go -difficulty=N -blocksize=N -data=filename.json <command>
```

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-difficulty` | Leading zeros required when mining | `4` |
| `-blocksize` | Maximum transactions allowed per block | `5` |
| `-data` | Path to the blockchain JSON file | `blockchain.json` |

All flags are optional and fall back to sensible defaults if omitted. If `-difficulty` is set below the configured minimum (`MinDifficulty`), it is raised to the minimum automatically, with a message explaining why.

Examples:

```bash
# Mine with a lower difficulty (faster, useful for testing)
go run main.go -difficulty=2 mine

# Limit each block to 2 transactions
go run main.go -blocksize=2 mine

# Use a separate data file, e.g. for a second, independent chain
go run main.go -data=testchain.json print
```

Each block stores the difficulty it was actually mined at, so blocks mined under different `-difficulty` values can coexist correctly in the same chain — validation always checks a block against its own recorded difficulty, not a single global value, and rejects any block whose recorded difficulty falls below the configured minimum.

---

# Running the Application

## Show available commands

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Add a transaction

```bash
go run main.go add Alice Bob 20
```

The transaction is validated before being added to the pending transaction pool. Validation includes:

- Amount must be positive
- Sender must not be empty or the reserved name `SYSTEM` (case-insensitive) — this prevents user input from minting funds out of nowhere
- Sender must have sufficient balance (including any other transactions already pending)

## Mine pending transactions

```bash
go run main.go mine
```

Before mining, the pending pool (loaded from `pending.json`, which is user-editable) is re-validated: sender validity and balances are re-checked against a temporary ledger, and mining aborts if anything invalid is found. Mining uses the configured difficulty (default, or whatever `-difficulty` was passed). During mining the application displays:

- Difficulty
- Nonce found
- Generated hash
- Mining time

After mining:

- A new block is appended to the blockchain
- The blockchain is saved to disk explicitly (mining itself has no persistence side effect)
- Only as many transactions as `-blocksize` allows are mined; any remainder stays in the pending pool for the next `mine` call, rather than blocking mining entirely

## Print the blockchain

```bash
go run main.go print
```

## Display account balances

```bash
go run main.go balance
```

## Validate the blockchain

```bash
go run main.go validate
```

Reports `Valid: true` or `Valid: false`, and on failure names the first block and the specific check that failed. The blockchain is also validated automatically whenever it is loaded from disk at startup, so a hand-edited `blockchain.json` is caught immediately rather than only when `validate` happens to be run.

## Demonstration mode

```bash
go run main.go demo
```

Runs a self-contained walkthrough that:

- Creates two sample transactions (`Alice -> Bob : 20`, `Bob -> Charlie : 10`)
- Mines each into its own block
- Saves the resulting chain to disk
- Prints the blockchain
- Validates the chain and reports the result

`demo` does not currently tamper with a block itself — for a tamper-and-detect walkthrough, see the tamper-evidence experiment in `report.md`, which shows the before/after validation output from editing a transaction directly in `blockchain.json`.

---

# Running Tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

The test suite covers:

- Deterministic hashing, and that the `Hash` field itself is excluded from its own calculation
- Hash changing when transactions or difficulty change
- Genesis block creation, its coinbase-seeded initial balances, and that genesis is fully deterministic (fixed timestamp and hash across independently created chains)
- Mining meeting the configured difficulty target
- Mined nonce reproducing the exact stored hash
- Full-chain validation on an honest chain
- Five distinct tamper scenarios, each verified to fail at the specific check it targets rather than just at hash integrity: a raw transaction edit (hash mismatch), a broken previous-hash link, an altered index, an altered timestamp, and a block whose hash doesn't satisfy its recorded proof-of-work
- A chain containing an overspending transaction (smuggled in via a hand-edited pending pool) failing validation through ledger replay, not just being silently skipped
- Transaction rejection for non-positive amounts and overspending at the ledger level, with balances confirmed unchanged in both cases
- Correct minting behaviour for empty-sender (coinbase) transactions at the ledger level, and rejection of empty/reserved senders at the CLI level
- Blockchain and pending-pool persistence (save and reload)

# Design Decisions

## Block Structure

Each block contains:

- Index
- Timestamp
- Transactions
- Previous Hash
- Nonce
- Difficulty
- Hash

## Genesis Block

The chain starts with a deterministic genesis block, built entirely from fixed constants (`GenesisTimestamp`, `GenesisPreviousHash`) rather than the current time — two independently created blockchains produce byte-identical genesis blocks, including the same hash. Its previous hash is a fixed value of 64 zero characters, and it is always at index 0.

Unlike later blocks, the genesis block contains two coinbase (faucet) transactions — sender left empty to represent system-issued funds — that introduce the initial currency supply directly on-chain:

```
SYSTEM -> Alice : 100
SYSTEM -> Bob   : 50
```

This means account balances, including the starting ones, are derived entirely by replaying the chain. No balance is stored or set outside of it.

## Deterministic Hashing

Each block's hash is computed with SHA-256 over a stable JSON serialization of the following fields, in this exact order:

1. Index
2. Timestamp
3. Transactions
4. PreviousHash
5. Nonce
6. Difficulty

The `Hash` field itself is intentionally excluded from its own calculation. Hashing the same block twice always produces the same result. Including `Difficulty` in the hash means tampering with a block's recorded difficulty is caught by the same hash-integrity check used for transaction tampering.

## Proof-of-Work Mining

Mining repeatedly increments the nonce until the resulting SHA-256 hash begins with the required number of leading zero hex digits. Each block stores the difficulty it was actually mined at (rather than relying on a single shared value), which is what allows different blocks in the same chain to have been mined at different difficulties and still validate correctly. Validation additionally enforces a configured minimum difficulty (`MinDifficulty`), so a block can't claim to have been mined at a suspiciously low difficulty to make forging the rest of the chain cheaper.

Mining reports the difficulty used, the nonce found, the resulting hash, and how long mining took.

## Ledger

The ledger stores no balances of its own between runs. Every balance is reconstructed by replaying every transaction in every block, starting from genesis. A transaction is rejected if its amount is not positive, or if the sender's balance (as of the pending pool, including other not-yet-mined transactions) is insufficient to cover it. An empty sender is treated as a coinbase/faucet mint and is never debited — but the CLI's `add` command rejects an empty or reserved (`SYSTEM`) sender coming from user input, so this minting path is only ever reachable from genesis, not from user commands.

## Blockchain Validation

For every block, validation checks:

- The stored hash matches a fresh recomputation (catches tampering with any field, including transactions and difficulty)
- The previous-hash link matches the prior block's actual hash
- Block indexes are sequential
- Timestamps are non-decreasing
- The block's recorded difficulty is at or above the configured minimum
- The block's hash satisfies proof-of-work at its own recorded difficulty
- Every transaction in the block replays cleanly against a running ledger — a non-positive amount or an overspend anywhere in the chain's history fails validation, rather than being silently skipped

The genesis block is additionally checked for a correct fixed previous-hash and index 0.

Validation returns a clear pass/fail result and, on failure, identifies the first invalid block and which specific check caught the problem. The blockchain is also run through this same validation automatically when loaded from disk at startup.

## Persistence

State is stored as JSON in two files, both configurable via flags:

- `blockchain.json` — the full chain
- `pending.json` — transactions added but not yet mined

Both are loaded automatically on startup (a fresh, empty version is created if the file doesn't exist yet) and saved after relevant commands, so state survives between separate invocations of the program. Chain persistence is now an explicit step after mining rather than a side effect inside `AddBlock`, so core chain logic stays decoupled from disk I/O.

## Configurable Parameters (FR-9)

Difficulty, maximum block size, and the data file path are all configurable via command-line flags (`-difficulty`, `-blocksize`, `-data`), parsed once at startup in `main.go` and bound directly to package-level variables in `chain/config.go`. All three have sensible defaults and can be left unset. A configured difficulty below `MinDifficulty` is automatically raised, rather than silently producing blocks that later fail validation.

# Known Limitations

This project is intended for educational purposes and intentionally omits several features found in production blockchains:

- Peer-to-peer networking
- Distributed consensus
- Public/private key cryptography or digital signatures
- Wallet management
- Merkle trees
- Smart contracts
- Automatic difficulty adjustment (retargeting)
- Mining rewards beyond the genesis coinbase transactions
- Chain forks or fork resolution

Additionally, worth being explicit about:

- **Breaking changes to the `Block` struct affect old data files.** Adding the `Difficulty` field to `Block` changed what goes into the hash calculation. A `blockchain.json` saved by an earlier version of this program (before `Difficulty` existed) will fail validation if loaded by the current version, since its originally stored hash was computed without that field. There is no schema versioning to handle this gracefully — old data files should be deleted rather than reused across versions of the code.
- **Pending-pool balance checks are advisory, not final.** A transaction is validated against a temporary ledger clone at `add` time (accounting for other pending transactions), but the ledger itself isn't finalized until the block is actually mined. `mine` re-validates the pending pool before mining, but a transaction can still be invalidated between `add` and `mine` if other transactions are added or the pool is hand-edited in between.
- **`demo` ignores errors from `AddBlock`.** If mining fails inside `demo` (for example, an oversized batch), the error is currently not checked, so failure would go unreported. This doesn't affect correctness of the main CLI paths (`add`/`mine`), which do check `AddBlock`'s return value.
- **Saves are not atomic.** Both `SaveToFile` and `SavePending` write directly with `os.WriteFile`, so a crash mid-write could in principle corrupt the JSON file. A temp-file-and-rename approach would close this gap.

# Assessment Notes

This project was implemented to satisfy the Backend Engineering Internship Golang Developer Assessment. Key implementation decisions:

- Deterministic genesis block, built from fixed constants and seeded with on-chain coinbase transactions rather than hardcoded ledger credits
- Ledger reconstructed entirely from blockchain history — no balances stored outside the chain
- SHA-256 deterministic hashing, with difficulty included in the hashed fields
- Proof-of-Work mining with difficulty stored per block and floored at a configured minimum, so validation always checks a block against the difficulty it was actually mined at and rejects suspiciously cheap difficulty claims
- Chain validation includes full ledger replay, and runs automatically on load from disk, not just when `validate` is invoked
- Full blockchain and pending-pool persistence using JSON, with the pending pool re-validated before mining
- Difficulty, block size, and data file path configurable via CLI flags with sensible defaults (FR-9)
- Command-line interface covering all required operations, with CLI-level rejection of empty/reserved senders
- Unit tests covering hashing determinism, mining, validation (five distinct, individually-verified tamper scenarios plus ledger-replay failure), transaction rejection, minting, and persistence

See `report.md` for the research component: tamper-evidence experiment output, a difficulty-versus-mining-time table and analysis, the hashing/validation design write-up, and answers to the discussion questions.
